This library uses the [mcl](https://github.com/herumi/mcl) library for cryptographic computation.

Note: This library does not support fully unlinkable mode and forces the basename, but it may be updated shortly.

## Dependecies

This library requires a `clang` compiler to build. 

If you use Ubuntu, you can install it with the command ;
> apt install clang

## Note

This library expects that it is used for research, not the real world.  

Nevertheless, if you want to use this library for practical usages,   
**YOU NEED TO CHECK ITS CODES AND USE IT AT OWN RISK**.
